# `tftensor-core`: A Rust-based Tensor Library with Automatic Differentiation

`tftensor-core` is a tensor library implemented in Rust, designed to be a lightweight and <s>efficient</s> alternative to libraries like NumPy and PyTorch. It offers tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and supports basic neural network training functionalities.

## Features

- **Tensor Operations**: Support for a wide range of tensor operations including reshaping, slicing, and mathematical operations.
- **Statistical Operations**: Compute mean, sum, max, and min along specified dimensions.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Built-in support for automatic gradient computation, making it suitable for machine learning and neural network training.
- **Random Number Generation**: Functions to generate tensors with random values, zeros, ones, and filled with specific values.
- **Integration with Python**: Provides a Python interface through PyO3, allowing for easy integration and use in Python projects.
